# Sass Button Theme library.

Beacuse every project has buttons. The SASS is somewhat documented. Enjoy!
 
## usage

* clone repo or download the zip file
* go to the project's root directory

```
npm install  -- installs dependencies from package.json
```
run the gulp file 
```
gulp dev     -- To stop server, press CTRL+C
```
```
gulp     -- build for production (no server)
```

## Change the button styles to your liking and use them in your next SASS project!
